        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough: Add flour and salt to a mixing bowl, then 
                add the water NOT at once but little by little to the flour, 
                and whisk to combine. Knead it until it becomes smooth from 
                inside out. Cover with a plastic wrap and set it in room
                temperature for 15 min. 
            </li>
            <li>In the meanwhile, remove the chicken’s neck, chop the chicken 
                into small bite-sized pieces (with bone), without chicken's 
                head and feet and the skin still intact. Wash them to remove 
                the blood and bone fragments. Add them to boiling water for 
                2-3 minutes, strain out all excess water.   
            </li>
            <li>Prep the rest of the ingredients and display them on a plate, 
                so it's easier while you put them in the pan. 
            </li>
            <li>To fry and braise:  Warm up the pan (make sure the pan is dry), 
                add the oil, heat it up over medium-high. Add sugar, whisk 
                it, until the sugar is melted in the oil (you’ll see some 
                bubbles in the melted sugar in the oil). Add the chicken, 
                brown them.
            </li>
            <li>Add hot red chilies, the hard/white section of the scallion 
                (keep the green pieces for at the end), ginger and potato. 
                Mix. Add the water. Add star anise, paprika powder, chili 
                flakes, soy sauce, salt and the Sichuan pepper powder. Mix. 
                Bring it to boil, turn the fire down to medium-low heat to a 
                simmer and let it braise for 15 min. 
            </li>
            <li>Prepare boiling water (2L) for the noodle in a separate 
                (sauce)pan. 
            </li>
            <li>To make the noodle: cover lightly your palms, the working 
                surface and the rested dough with a layer of oil. Use a 
                rolling pin and roll out the dough in a rectangle form, 
                (the dough should be slightly oily) turn it around and 
                continue with the other side, put oil on it, if it feels 
                dry. Roll it out until you reach the thickness of 2-3mm, make 
                the surface even and smooth. Cut it into 3cm wide, long strips.
                If you want it to be thinner, you can bounce the fingerprint 
                noodle at the table by holding the ends between your hands 
                while you stretch them. Repeat this with the rest of the 
                strips. 
            </li>
            <li>To boil: Put the noodle into the boiling water, move the 
                noodles around immediately so they won't stick to each other. 
                Cook 2 to 3 minutes. Take the noodles out with a strainer, 
                shortly wash it in cold water, so they stop cooking. Strain 
                out all excess water. 
            </li>
            <li>To serve: hot served on a big shared plate, 3-4 people per 
                plate, the stew is plated on top of the noodles, so the noodle 
                soak up all the aromatic sauce. Enjoy!!
            </li>
