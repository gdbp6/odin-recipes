        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put Sichuan peppercorn into pan on low heat. Stir to bring
                out the aroma of the peppercorn. 2 to 3 minutes will suffice.
            </li>
            <li>Once the temperature of the peppercorn has cooled, ground the 
                peppercorn into powder.
            </li>
            <li>In a pot of water, add salt. Cut tofu into cubes. Put the 
                tofu into the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiled, turn 
                off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>On a cutting board, chop up about 3 spoonful of Bean paste and
                a couple fermented black beans together. 
            </li>
            <li>Mince up some scallion, ginger, and garlic.</li>
            <li>In a hot pan, add in oil. Add in the ground pork and cook 
                until the color changes. Then add in the bean paste mixture.
                Stir to cover and color all the meat. Add in the minced 
                scallion, ginger, and garlic. Continue to stir.
            </li>
            <li>Add in chili flakes and stir to cover everything. Add in 
                cooking wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and continue 
                to stir.
            </li>
            <li>Add in water and bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiled, add in the tofu and some peppercorn powder. 
                Stir to mix.
            </li>
            <li>To thicken the broth, create a thickening mixture with
                starch and water. Pour in the mixture in three separate
                intervals, mixing gently after each. Afterwards, sprinkle
                some scallions on top, turn the heat off, and plate it.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle some peppercorn powder and scallion on top of the 
                dish and serve over rice. 
            </li>
        </ol>
