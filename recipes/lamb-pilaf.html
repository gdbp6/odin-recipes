        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>lamb of choice 1 lb</li>
            <li>onion 1 large</li>
            <li>carrot 2 large</li>
            <li>white rice 1.5 cup</li>
            <li>avocado oil 50ml</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt 10g</li>
            <li>cumin 10g</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice several times and let it soak for 30mins.</li>
            <li>Cut the lamb into chunks. Slice the onion and carrot into
                slices of about 0.8cm wide.
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) If lamb has a very strong odor or you just 
                don't like the smell of lamb, put it into a pot with water
                and bring to boil. Once boiled, add in some coriander,
                sichuan peppercorn, and cooking wine. Let it boil for a few
                more minutes. Take the lamb out and rinse it under hot water.
            </li>
            <li>Add oil to a deep pan. When it reaches high heat, add onion 
                to the pan and cook until it becomes transparent. Then add meat
                to the pan and cook until it's color slightly browns. Then take
                out the onion and meat. 
            </li>
            <li>Add carrots to the pan and cook until it becomes soft.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onion and meat back into the pan. Add salt and cumin
                and cook for a few minutes. Then add water to cover the 
                ingredients and bring to a boil with cover on.
            </li>
            <li>Once boiled, lower it to a simmer. Add in the soaked rice
                and lay it evenly on top of the other ingredients. (Optional:
                Add in as much raisin as you'd like at this point.) Make a
                few holes in the layer of rice. Let it simmer on low for 35
                minutes. Check occasionally to make sure it doesn't dry out and
                burn.
            </li>
            <li>Open the lid and make sure water from the lid doesn't drip 
                back onto the rice. Stir and mix all the ingredients from the 
                bottom of pan.
            </li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
