# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate, through building a website,
the understanding of the html section of The Odin Project's Foundations
course.

Once I've completed the project, I should have a website homepage that
links to three different webpages, each of which includes an image of a
dish, a description, the ingredients needed, as well as the steps for making
the dish. 

To do this, I will be using all the html elements I've learned in this section
as well as putting into practice the git basics such as staging, committing,
and pushing.
