# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate, through building a website,
my understanding of the html section of The Odin Project's Foundations
course.

I created a website homepage that links to three different webpages, each of
which includes a dish name, an image of the dish, a description, the 
ingredients needed, as well as the steps for making the dish. 

I put into practice all the html elements learned in the html section
as well as the git basics such as staging, committing, and pushing.
